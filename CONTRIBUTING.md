Heat Pump Hydraulic Card deliberately keeps its toolchain small. The browser-based self-test is the main regression suite; Playwright only starts the local server and runs that same suite in Chromium and Firefox.

## Setup

Use Node.js 22 or newer, then install the locked dependencies and browsers:

```bash
npm ci
npm run browsers:install
```

Start the live demo at <http://127.0.0.1:4173/demo/>:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Checks

Run the complete local gate before opening a pull request:

```bash
npm run check
```

For a faster loop, use `npm run test:chromium`, `npm run test:firefox`, or the interactive `npm run test:ui`. A failed browser test keeps a trace, screenshot, video and text log in `test-results/`; open the HTML summary with `npx playwright show-report`.

New setups and scenarios belong in `demo/setups.js`; assertions belong in `test/selftest.html`. Keep tests deterministic and independent of Home Assistant, the internet and real installations.

### Topology test and drawing snapshot

`test/topology.html` runs next to the self-test and guards the drawing and the flow logic:

- **Snapshot.** Every demo setup in every layout and scenario, and every generated combination in every operating state, is reduced to two fingerprints – the geometry of the schematic and its state (which pipe flows, classes, colours, texts) – and compared with `test/topology-snapshot.js`. A refactor must leave both unchanged.
- **Combinations.** The storage strategies the card draws (direct, parallel buffer, series buffer with and without bypass valve) × hot-water tank (none, tank, tank with solar thermal) × primary pump × 1–6 heating circuits, with source type, emitters, heaters, power sources and layout rotating through the cases. Each combination must render; every pipe must end at another pipe or a component; a flowing pipe must not end at a closed one; components must not overlap; the drawing must stay inside its view box; and the schematic must stay one tab stop with labelled parts.
- **Visible geometry.** Every demo scenario and generated operating state also checks rendered SVG label bounds against other labels, appliance bodies and the view box. A separate matrix exercises all 16 heater subsets on each storage wall with solar and fresh-water ports, including narrow layouts and cooling readouts. Failures identify the configuration and the two elements. Extend the interacting options and their geometry checks when adding a part. The storage and circuit layout rules are in [the topology plan](docs/TOPOLOGY.md#collision-checks).

A change that alters the drawing on purpose (a new part, a moved label, a changed text) updates the baseline in the same pull request:

```bash
npm run topology:update
```

To see what moved, write the full descriptions before and after the change and compare them:

```bash
node scripts/topology-snapshot.mjs --out before.json
node scripts/topology-snapshot.mjs --diff before.json after.json
```

A label whose text depends on the language, a configured name or a value gets a width budget (`data-fit`, schematic units) up to the next obstacle. The topology test draws everything once more with the longest translation of every text, wide values and long names, and English labels must fit their budget unshortened. To look at single cases, open `test/topology.html?only=<regular expression>` in the dev server.

If `test/topology-snapshot.js` conflicts after `main` was merged into a branch, do not merge it by hand: take either side and run `npm run topology:update` again.

The update command runs the geometric and flow checks before replacing the baseline. The full description export remains available to diagnose a failing drawing.

The flow logic lives in one method, `_flowModel()`: it decides the operating state, the open side of the diverter valve, the series-buffer bypass and which pipe, circuit and loop flows; `_update()` only draws it. A new hydraulic part adds its pipes there instead of new flags in the drawing code. Without a parallel buffer the circuits and the heat pump are one water loop: the flow model moves them together, and each circuit has a `pump` (its impeller turns) apart from `on` (water flows through it).

## Pull requests without merge conflicts

Several pull requests are usually open at once. Files that every change edits make them collide, so a pull request keeps to these rules:

- **Do not edit `README.md` or `CHANGELOG.md`.** The maintainer updates the list of supported heat pumps, the feature list, the German summary and the preset list of the bug report template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml`) when merging.
- **Changelog:** add one file `changelog.d/<pull request number or topic>.md` with the entry as a bullet list (see `changelog.d/README.md`). At release time `npm run changelog:compile` moves the fragments into `CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Preset documentation** goes into `docs/presets/<preset>.md`: what is mapped, what is deliberately not, the evidence (integration source, real installation) and the known limits. Describe the same in the pull request text.
- **Do not list presets in the header comment of `dist/heatpump-hydraulic-card.js`;** it is generic on purpose.
- Add tests as one block with their own section heading in `test/selftest.html`, and refer to demo setups by name, not by position in the list.
- If a pull request still conflicts after another one was merged, merge `main` into the branch and keep both sides of each conflict; the maintainer can do this for you when "Allow edits by maintainers" is on.

## Translations

Languages are built into the card and may be partial. [docs/TRANSLATING.md](docs/TRANSLATING.md) explains where the texts live and how to add a language. `npm run i18n:check` (part of `npm run syntax`) verifies the language blocks and lists missing texts. Add a changelog fragment, do not edit `README.md`.

## Release contract

`npm run release:check` verifies that `package.json`, `HFC_VERSION`, the HACS distribution filename and the changelog agree and that the changelog fragments are well-formed. On a tag build, the tag must be `v<version>` and no fragment may be left in `changelog.d/`. Before tagging, run `npm run changelog:compile` in the release pull request and rename the `## Unreleased` heading to the version. The same command brings `docs/COVERAGE.md` and the coverage cells of the README up to date (`npm run coverage`); on a release branch (`release-<version>`) `npm run syntax` fails while they are stale, so the release pull request cannot be merged with old numbers.

The recommended required checks for the default branch are `HACS validation`, `Quality`, `Browser / chromium` and `Browser / firefox`.

## Issue and release lifecycle

- Bugs take priority over enhancements. Reproduce them first and add a regression test with the fix.
- Do not guess preset entity mappings. Add them only from integration source evidence or reviewed diagnostic data from a real installation.
- A merged change that has not shipped stays open with the `ready for release` label. The merge comment should link the pull request and summarize its checks.
- When the containing version is published, assign its version milestone, remove `ready for release`, add a release comment and close the issue.
- Contributor-owned pull requests stay with their contributor unless they explicitly hand over the work. Follow-up work should not silently absorb or replace them.
- Umbrella issues remain open while only one sub-part is delivered; record the shipped part in a comment and keep the remaining scope explicit.

## Tracking upstream integrations

Presets depend on other projects' entity ids and state texts. `upstream/<preset>.json` lists the repositories and files a preset is built on, and the workflow `Upstream watch` opens one issue per preset when those files change (see `upstream/README.md`). A pull request for a new preset adds its own `upstream/<preset>.json`. After reviewing an upstream change, run `npm run upstream:ack -- <preset>` and close the issue.

## Preset and language coverage

[docs/COVERAGE.md](docs/COVERAGE.md) shows how much of the card each preset can fill and how complete each language is; the coverage of each preset in the README's list of supported heat pumps comes from it. `scripts/coverage.mjs` measures it from the card: every lookup of a preset is answered as if the entity existed, so the numbers do not depend on one installation. A field the integration does not offer, or offers in a form that does not fit, goes into `unmapped` of `upstream/<preset>.json` with a short reason, and leaves the percentage; `npm run coverage -- --open` lists the fields that are neither mapped nor explained. `npm run syntax` checks that every `unmapped` entry names a counted field that the preset does not map. Contributions do not regenerate the page or the README; the release pull request does (see [Release contract](#release-contract)).
