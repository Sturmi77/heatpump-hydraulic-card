# Bosch, Buderus, Junkers, Nefit, Worcester, Sieger, elm.leblanc, iVT (EMS-ESP)

Preset `emsesp`. Back to the [README](../../README.md#supported-heat-pumps).

Confirmed on a real Buderus Logatherm WLW186i-5 TP70 installation with an EMS-ESP BBQKees gateway (#220). Other EMS/EMS+ heat-pump models remain welcome test coverage.

## Setup

```yaml
type: custom:heatpump-flow-card
preset: emsesp
```
For heat pumps on the EMS bus via the [EMS-ESP](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32) gateway with Home Assistant MQTT discovery. The preset accepts both the established EMS-ESP short ids (`boiler_hpactivity`, `boiler_hptc1`, …) and the descriptive Home Assistant object ids of the "long names" entity format (`boiler_compressor_activity`, `boiler_heat_carrier_forward_tc1`, …). With long names the heat pump flow and return come from TC1/TC0 (`boiler_heat_carrier_forward_tc1`, `…_return_tc0`) before the system flow; with both hot-water sensors, `boiler_dhw_current_intern_temperature` is the tank top and `…_extern_temperature` the bottom, with only the external one it is the top. The long-name list was confirmed on a Nefit EnviLine with EMS-ESP 3.8.6 (#257). An instance prefix from the "multiple instances" entity format (e.g. `sensor.ems_esp_boiler_…`) is detected automatically. Compressor activity texts are understood in English and German.

What you get:
- compressor activity (heating, hot water, cooling, defrost) as the mode
- compressor running, 3-way valve, current electrical compressor power
- heat carrier flow and return (TC1/TC0, falling back to the boiler flow and return)
- flow rate PC0
- air inlet (TL2), or brine inlet and outlet for ground source heat pumps (`source_type: brine`)
- auxiliary heater status as the backup heater
- outdoor temperature
- DHW temperature, target and circulation
- mixer circuit 1 flow and pump
- thermostat room temperature and target
- details: compressor operating time and starts, total energy consumed and supplied, compressor speed, refrigerant temperatures (PL1, PH1, TR3, TR5, TR6)

Without a heat output sensor, the heat output is estimated from flow rate × spread. With `hc_count: 2` (up to 6) the mixer and thermostat entities of the further circuits are added; `index: {hc: 2}` starts at circuit 2 instead.

### PV, battery and grid

Do not map whole-house PV production, battery power or grid import directly to `pv`, `battery` and `grid`: explicit entities are interpreted as the part of the heat pump's consumption supplied by that source. Leave those overrides empty with `power_sources: auto` to let the card split the mapped heat-pump power by the current Energy-dashboard supply mix. Use `power_sources: manual` only when the mapped source sensors already measure the heat pump's individual shares.

The preset draws the hydraulic components, not the casing of an indoor unit. An integrated small buffer is represented by its mapped buffer sensor and the buffer symbol; a vendor-specific indoor-unit enclosure is a separate drawing feature.
