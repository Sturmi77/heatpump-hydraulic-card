# Vaillant aroTHERM (ebusd)

Preset `ebusd`. Back to the [README](../../README.md#supported-heat-pumps).

## Setup

```yaml
type: custom:heatpump-flow-card
preset: ebusd
hc_count: 2
```
For Vaillant aroTHERM and aroTHERM plus outdoor units (eBUS circuit `hmu`) read by [ebusd](https://github.com/john30/ebusd) with its Home Assistant MQTT discovery, together with the VWZ hydraulic station (`vwzio`) and a sensoCOMFORT or multiMATIC controller (`ctlv2`, `ctlv3`, `ctls2`). Entity ids follow `<topic prefix>_<circuit>_<message>`, for example `sensor.ebusd_hmu_rundatastatuscode`. Home Assistant may put the device name in front (`sensor.heating_ebusd_hmu_…`); both forms are found. A different topic prefix than `ebusd` is set with `prefix`.

What you get:
- operating state from `RunDataStatuscode` (heating, hot water, cooling, defrost, blocked, frost protection; fault codes show as text)
- flow, return, building-circuit flow rate, air inlet and outdoor temperature
- electrical power and heat output of the outdoor unit, giving a live COP
- compressor speed as "running"; the diverter valve from the hydraulic station's hot water flag (`vwzio_statusdhw_dhwactive`) where ebusd reports it, otherwise from the operating state (`hwc_…` is hot water)
- DHW temperature and target, heating circuits with flow, target and pump from the controller, zone room temperature and target
- heating-circuit pressure (outdoor unit, else controller)
- details and tiles: compressor hours and starts, heater hours, electricity per mode, environmental energy, evaporation, suction and hot-gas temperature, high pressure, expansion valve, superheat

Notes:
- The controller reports every circuit it knows, inactive ones included, so set `hc_count` yourself.
- The buffer is not mapped: which VR 70 / VR 71 sensor sits in it depends on the hydraulic scheme. Add `buffer_top` (and `buffer_bottom`) under `entities`.
- In a cascade of two outdoor units, ebusd reads only the unit on the bus; power, heat and the counters belong to that unit.
- Do not map the controller's `…_ctlv2_z1valvestatus` as `valve`: it is the valve of zone 1 (open or closed), closed also in standby, in summer and while another zone heats, so the card would show hot water at those times. Without a valve entity the card takes hot water from the operating state, which is the reliable source here.
- Saunier Duval GeniaAir units use the same HMU and work with this preset; set `unit_style: saunier` for their drawing.
- Older geoTHERM and other units on the `ehp` circuit are not covered yet (#24).
